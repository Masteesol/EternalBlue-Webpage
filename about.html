            <h1>About Eternal Blue</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Eternal Blue is a group consisting of me, Marius, and my wife, Francine. We are both students within the IT field. 
                    I study frontend web development and Francine studies cyber security.</p>
                <p>The artist name comes from the notorious cyberattack exploit called EternalBlue, and we thought it was apt.</p>
                <p>The music is written and produced by us and recorded in a small guest room in our apartment, 
                    much to our neighbors' dismay.</p>
                <p>The music is inspired by a plethora of bands and artists, and lately we’ve 
                    taken a liking to synth-wave, which has been an inspiration for the music of the next album we’re working on. That, and the soundtrack of cyberpunk games, like Deus Ex: Human Revolution. </p>
