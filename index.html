                        Open your eyes <br>Walk to the mirror <br>Check your smile <br>Choke away the tears <br><br>
                        Put on a face <br>Show you don't care and <br>Don't leave a trace <br>Of sadness that's wearing you <br><br>
                        Down - look at all the things you own, go browse for more, <br> make lists, collapse, relapse, say 'I'll stay strong' <br> and break the word to fill the void of<br>Having nothing to yourself besides pretentious thoughts of more <br>than you were destined to fulfil to not be someone you avoid <br><br>
                        To be or not the choice is yours; <br>To make the most out of the worst <br><br>
                        You hide yourself behind bars, <br> behind backs, behind eyes, <br> seeking shelter in <br> absent-minded revelling <br><br>I sense your fear, know you're here, <br> feel your end <br> drawing near <br> - I'll show you who the Devil is <br><br>
                        You run away, just like prey, <br> go astray, growing frail, <br> seeking purpose away <br> from all your evil thoughts <br>I see you going insane, <br> wash your life down the drain, <br>no help from your beloved gods <br><br>
                        Post things online <br>Read some sad stories <br>Live others' lives <br>Without feeling sorry <br><br>See comments say <br>"You're so sophisticated" <br>Living like this <br>You feel suffocated <br><br>
                        Read through all the praise your pretty face <br> makes all the mindless people spew at lightning speed <br> onto your screen to feel your empty shell <br>
                        Become so full of shit with every breath you take <br>, mistakes you make, excitements faked that <br> you can't tell where you begin and end yourself <br><br>
                        Only you can tell what's fair <br><br>In this mire of despair <br>If you're brave enough to dare <br>Open arms into thin air <br>Catching angry, hateful glares <br>Feeling fire begin to flare <br>
                        Don't you think that it's unfair? <br><br>
                        You hide yourself behind bars, <br> behind backs, behind eyes, <br> seeking shelter in <br> absent-minded revelling <br><br>I sense your fear, know you're here, <br> feel your end <br> drawing near <br> - I'll show you who the Devil is <br><br>

                        This is <br>All so strange <br>Every <br>Little <br>Tiniest change <br><br>Makes your <br>Mind <br>Go insane <br>Unable <br>To handle the strain <br><br>Of the disapproving world collapsing onto you <br>
                        You hide yourself behind bars, <br> behind backs, behind eyes, <br> seeking shelter in <br> absent-minded revelling <br><br>I sense your fear, know you're here, <br> feel your end <br> drawing near <br> - I'll show you who the Devil is <br><br>

                        So unpleasant <br>So ill <br>Please no <br>Take me out <br>End my suffering, please end it <br>No! No! <br>I can't take this anymore <br>Make it stop, make it stop! <br><br>
                        This world is all in my mind,<br>But it's all I've got <br>Endless struggle, one of a kind <br>Hard to be a god <br><br>

                        Your pout becomes a shout: please help me, just let me out <br>Begging for the sword, the blade to the neck <br>, but the almighty does not comply <br>
                        So instead you inject to eject <br>cause your life is defect, come on do it, join the loser-sect <br><br>
                        Like dead amongst the living <br>Eating, breeding, killing <br>No single fuck is given <br>Cause now you are in heaven <br><br>Like dead amongst the living <br>
                        Grab all you can, no giving <br>A parasite who’s thriving <br>you’re keeping on surviving <br><br>
                        I have had enough of you all <br>Enough of myself <br>You keep pushing, dragging it out;<br>my last and final breath <br><br>
                        I’m chasing an enigma <br>a question to this answer <br>I’m chasing an enigma <br>a cure for the cancer <br><br>
                        Shaping the magma <br>Accepting the stigma <br>Shaping the magma <br>Chasing the enigma <br><br>
                        Come you all and witness the clown <br>Throw your shit and watch him drown <br>Don’t you hold back now, don’t let us down <br>We expect a good show, now fucking throw <br><br>
                        Stone after stone, there’s not much left <br>Were once was his face there’s now an open cleft <br>Split open this fucking losers head <br>
                        You won’t rest until he’s down and dead <br><br>
                        Shaping the magma <br>Accepting the stigma <br>Shaping the magma <br>Chasing the enigma <br><br>
                        I have had enough of you all <br>Enough of myself <br>You keep pushing, dragging it out;<br>my last and final breath <br><br>
                        I’m chasing an enigma <br>a question to this answer <br>I’m chasing an enigma <br>a cure for the cancer x2 <br><br>

                        I never wanted it to end this way <br>If you just loved me, all would be okay <br><br>Six feet in the ground <br>too deep to be found <br><br>
                        You always said to me that things were fine <br>I would be yours and that you'd be mine <br>
                        Deep down, you'll drown <br>No light, no sound <br>Dissolve - Absolve <br>me of this crime <br><br>
                        I feel it crawling <br>I hear it calling <br>It's getting closer <br>I feel it's breath <br>Grabbing hold, embracing death <br><br>
                        There's no way I'll let you go <br>Down to hell, and far below <br>Falling deeper <br>until we reach the core <br><br>
                        Insanity - come merge with me <br>My avarice -  your vanity <br><br>
                        I never wanted you to go away <br>Now you're tied up, you'll always stay <br><br>
                        Tear off your crown <br>You know it's mine <br>Tear up your gown <br>Nothing is fine <br><br>
                        Why are you crying? <br>You were just smiling <br>and laughing at my fragile mind <br><br>
                        There's no way I'll let you go <br>Down to hell, and far below <br>Falling deeper <br>until we reach the core <br><br>
                        Insanity - come merge with me <br>Your pride with my wrath <br><br>
                        I'm out of breath <br>I know this isn't real <br>So close to death <br>Tearing off this seal <br><br>
                        Your eyes shine through this haze <br>breaking up this fucked up gaze <br>Resiprocate with frightened eyes <br>But nothing's real till' someone dies <br><br>
                        Your beauty radiates throughout my mind <br>sparking cancer cells to bloom around <br><br>
                        Six feet in the ground <br>too deep to be found <br><br>You always spoke in such poetic terms <br>Even when muffled up, you teach and I learn <br><br>
                        Up high, I soar <br>No air, no cure <br>Been here before <br>this looping door <br><br>
                        Repeating patterns <br>These silhuettes <br>Grabbing hold, embracing death <br><br>
                        There's no way I'll let you go <br>Down to hell, and far below <br>Falling deeper <br>until we reach the core <br><br>
                        There's no way I'll let you go <br>Down to hell, and far below <br>Though, we never have shared a single word <br><br>
                        Insanity - come merge with me <br>My avarice- your vanity <br>Insanity - come merge with me <br>Your pride with my wrath <br><br>
